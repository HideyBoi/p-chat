# Private Chat
### A chatting web application I orgininally made to bypass my school's internet blocker so I could talk with my friends. I've recently expanded and changed it, and am now using it for more than just chatting in class.

Created in React.JS (create-react-app) and uses Firebase for storing messages, rooms, and syncing typing indicators.
Hosted on GH Pages.
